# MDX Sample Document

This is a sample **MDX** document that combines markdown with JSX components.

## Introduction

Welcome to the MDX translator test! This file contains both markdown content and JSX elements.

### Standard Markdown

Here's some regular markdown content:

- List item one
- List item two with **bold text**
- List item three with [a link](https://example.com)

### Code Block

```javascript
function HelloWorld() {
    return <div>Hello from React!</div>;
}
```

### JSX Components

<div className="alert alert-info">
  This is a JSX div element that should remain **untranslated** in its structure,
  but the text content inside should be translated.
</div>

<CustomComponent 
  title="Sample Title" 
  description="This description should be translated"
>
  The content inside this component should also be translated.
</CustomComponent>

### Mixed Content

You can mix markdown with JSX seamlessly:

<div style={{border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '1rem'}}>
  
  ## Nested Markdown Header
  
  This markdown content is **inside** a JSX div and should be translated.
  
  - Nested list item 1
  - Nested list item 2
  
</div>

## Conclusion

This MDX file tests the translation of markdown content while preserving JSX structure and attributes.
